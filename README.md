# GLENS
Repository for code analyzing stratospheric aerosol injection model output. This code is designed to work with output from the [Geoengineering Large ENSemble (GLENS)](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/projects/community-projects/GLENS/). However, flexibility is one of my goals for the code in this repository, and the medium-term intention is that it will apply to output from the [upcoming NCAR model runs performed under the Safe Climate Research Initiative](https://federallabs.org/news/ncar-noaa-lead-efforts-to-understand-risks-and-benefits-of-solar-geoenginering) with minimal tuning.

## Code description

### NCAR code (for Casper and Cheyenne)
`casper_starter`: Contains the generic header and export command required for all jobs run on Casper or Cheyenne.
